# Assignment 2 — Deploy A Static Website to AWS EC2 Using an Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, I imported and personalized the Static Website, provisioned and configured an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform and Ansible, and created an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline that automatically deployed the website to Nginx through an SSH Service Connection.

---

# Task 0 — Verify the Existing Tooling and Self-Hosted Agent

## Goal

Confirm that Terraform, Ansible, AWS CLI, SSH, and the self-hosted Azure Pipelines agent are ready.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 1 — Import and Personalize the Azure Static Website Repository

## Goal

Import the Azure Static Website into Azure Repos and add your Full Name to the website.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 1 — Azure Static Website in Azure Repos

Add a screenshot of Azure Repos showing:

* Imported Azure Static Website repository
* Project files
* `index.html`

# Task 2 — Provision and Configure the Target EC2 Instance

## Goal

Provision the AWS EC2 instance using Terraform and configure Nginx, SSH access, and deployment permissions using Ansible.

No additional submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 3 — Create the SSH Service Connection

## Goal

Create an Azure DevOps SSH Service Connection that can connect to the target EC2 instance using your selected SSH authentication method.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 2 — SSH Service Connection

Add a screenshot of the saved SSH Service Connection **Overview** page showing:

* Service Connection name
* SSH connection type

> Do not expose a password, SSH private key, passphrase, or another credential.

---

# Task 4 — Create the Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline

## Goal

Create an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline that deploys the Azure Static Website to the target EC2 instance after a commit is pushed.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 3 — Azure Pipelines YAML

Add a screenshot of `azure-pipelines.yml` open in the Azure Repos editor showing:

* Push trigger
* Selected self-hosted agent pool
* Pipeline variables
* Repository checkout step
* Pipeline information step
* `CopyFilesOverSSH@0` task
* `SSH@0` verification task

> Ensure that no password, SSH private key, PAT, or AWS credential is visible.

# Task 5 — Create, Authorize, and Run the Pipeline

## Goal

Run the Azure DevOps pipeline and confirm that the website files are transferred and verified successfully.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 4 — Successful Pipeline Run

Add a screenshot of the successful pipeline run and log summary showing:

* Overall pipeline status as **Succeeded**
* Pipeline information step completed
* File-copy step completed
* Remote-verification step completed
* Your Full Name visible in the pipeline output

# Task 6 — Verify the Website and Automatic Trigger

## Goal

Confirm that the website is accessible through the EC2 public IP address and that a new pushed commit automatically triggers another deployment.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 5 — Deployed Azure Static Website

Add a browser screenshot showing:

* Deployed Azure Static Website
* EC2 public IP address in the browser address bar
* Your Full Name
* Updated website content after the automatic deployment

<![Image5](screenshots/Assignment2_task5b.png)>

## Final Website URL

`http://<target-vm-public-ip>`

Replace the placeholder with your actual website URL:

http://4.227.217.231

# Assignment Summary

Write a short summary of the completed CI/CD workflow.

I encountered several issues during the deployment. The Ansible inventory initially contained an outdated VM IP address, which I updated to the new public IP. I also experienced an SSH host-key issue, which was resolved by establishing the initial SSH connection and verifying Ansible connectivity.

The Azure DevOps SSH service connection initially failed because password authentication was disabled on the VM. I enabled password authentication for the `azureuser` account and verified the SSH service connection successfully.

The pipeline then failed to copy files because `/var/www/html` was owned by `root`. I changed the directory ownership to `azureuser`, allowing the deployment task to write the website files.

Finally, the verification step initially treated the `curl` progress output as an error even though the website returned **HTTP 200 OK**. I changed the command from `curl -I http://localhost` to `curl -sI http://localhost`. The pipeline then completed successfully.

The final pipeline successfully checked out the code, deployed the website over SSH, verified Nginx, and confirmed the website was responding with **HTTP 200 OK**.
