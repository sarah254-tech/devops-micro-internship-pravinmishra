# Assignment 3 — Deploy React Application with Azure DevOps Pipeline

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, I builT and deployed the `my-react-app` React application to an Ubuntu VM using a multi-stage Azure Pipeline (Build → Test → Publish → Deploy) over SSH, with automatic triggering on commits to `main`.

---

# Task 1 — Import the React App

## Goal

Import `https://github.com/pravinmishraaws/my-react-app` into Azure Repos and confirm `package.json` and `src/` are visible.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Azure Repos showing the imported React project with `package.json` and `src/` visible

# Task 2 — Prepare the Target VM

## Goal

Provision a new Ubuntu VM with Terraform (ports 22/80 open) and prepare Nginx/`/var/www/html` with Ansible.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Terraform output or cloud console showing the new VM and public IP

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Terminal showing Ansible completed successfully and Nginx is active

---

# Task 3 — Create or Update the SSH Service Connection

## Goal

Point the `ubuntu-nginx-ssh` Service Connection to the new VM and validate it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — SSH Service Connection page showing the new VM connection and successful validation, with the password hidden

# Task 4 — Author a Multi-Stage Pipeline (YAML)

## Goal

Create the Build (npm install/build), Test (`npm test -- --watchAll=false`, blocking on failure), Publish (publish `build/` as `react_build`), and Deploy (copy artifact to `/var/www/html`, restart Nginx via SSH) stages, triggered on `main`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Azure Pipeline YAML definition with the Build, Test, Publish, and Deploy sections visible

# Task 5 — Run and Verify

## Goal

Confirm a commit to `main` triggers the pipeline, all four stages succeed, the build artifact is on the VM, and the React app is live.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Pipeline run summary showing Build, Test, Publish, and Deploy succeeded
