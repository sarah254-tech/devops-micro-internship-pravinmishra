# Assignment 3 — Docker Networking

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, I explored Docker networking by using default bridge, custom bridge, multiple bridge, and host network modes. I verified container communication, service discovery, network isolation, public access, and host networking on a Linux VM or EC2 instance.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy a Standalone Application Using the Default Bridge Network

## Goal

Deploy an Nginx web server using Docker’s default bridge network and access it through the VM public IP address.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Available Docker Networks

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls
```

The output must include the default `bridge`, `host`, and `none` networks.

#### Screenshot 3 — Running `myweb` Container

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the running `myweb` container with:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

#### Screenshot 4 — Nginx Welcome Page

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page at:

```text
http://40.121.8.188/
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

# Task 2 — Connect Containers Using a Custom Bridge Network

## Goal

Create a custom bridge network and verify that containers can communicate using container names rather than IP addresses.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — Custom Bridge Network Created

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing `mynetwork` in:

```bash
docker network ls
```

<![Image5](screenshots/Assignment3_task2a.png)>

#### Screenshot 6 — Running `web` and `client` Containers

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show both `web` and `client` containers running without published host ports.

<![Image6](screenshots/Assignment3_task2b.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Service Discovery by Container Name

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful output from:

```bash
docker exec client wget -qO- http://web
```

The output must display the Nginx Welcome Page HTML.

<![Image7](screenshots/Assignment3_task2c.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Custom Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect mynetwork
```

The output must show both `web` and `client` connected to `mynetwork`.

# Task 3 — Demonstrate Multi-Network Isolation

## Goal

Deploy frontend, backend, and database containers across two separate Docker networks. Verify allowed communication and confirm that the frontend cannot directly reach the database.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Two Docker Networks

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls
```

The output must include both `frontend-network` and `backend-network`.

<![Image9](screenshots/Assignment3_task3a.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Running Multi-Network Containers

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show:

- `frontend` with the published port mapping `0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp`
- `backend` without a published host port
- `db` without a published host port

<![Image10](screenshots/Assignment3_task3b.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Frontend Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect frontend-network
```

The output must show `frontend` and `backend`.

<![Image11](screenshots/Assignment3_task3c-1.png)>
<![Image11](screenshots/Assignment3_task3c-2.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Backend Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect backend-network
```

The output must show `backend` and `db`.

<![Image12](screenshots/Assignment3_task3d-1.png)>
<![Image12](screenshots/Assignment3_task3d-2.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Frontend-to-Backend Communication

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful output from:

```bash
docker exec frontend wget -qO- http://backend
```

The output must display the Nginx Welcome Page HTML.

<![Image13](screenshots/Assignment3_task3e.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Backend-to-Database Communication

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing a successful connection to `db` on port `27017` from the `backend` container.

<![Image14](screenshots/Assignment3_task3f.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Frontend-to-Database Isolation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that the `frontend` container cannot reach `db` on port `27017`.

The output must include:

```text
Expected result: frontend cannot reach db
```

<![Image15](screenshots/Assignment3_task3g.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Public Frontend Access

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page from the `frontend` container at:

```text
http://40.121.8.188/
```

# Networking Notes

Write a short note explaining:

1. Default bridge networking

Docker's default bridge network connects containers on the same network. Containers can communicate using IP addresses, but automatic container-name resolution is not provided in the same way as it is on a user-defined bridge network.

2. Container-name communication on a custom bridge network

A custom bridge network, such as mynetwork, allows connected containers to discover and communicate with one another using container names. In Task 2, the client container successfully accessed the web container using http://web, without needing to know its IP address.

3. Why the frontend could not access the database

In Task 3, the frontend container was connected only to frontend-network, while the db container was connected only to backend-network. Since they did not share a network, the frontend could not resolve the hostname db or connect directly to the database. The backend container connected both networks, allowing it to communicate with the frontend and database.

4. Bridge mode vs. host network mode

    Bridge mode: Containers use an isolated Docker network with their own network interfaces and IP addresses. Ports can be published to make services accessible outside the container.

    Host network mode: A container shares the host machine's network namespace. It does not have the same network isolation as a bridge-network container, and port publishing with -p is unnecessary.
