# Assignment 3 — Deployments: From Basics to Rolling Updates

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

Created an NGINX Deployment, configured RollingUpdate, updated the container image, rolled back to the previous revision, and scaled the workload.

---

# Task 0 — Pre-check: Remove the Assignment 02 ReplicaSet

## Goal

Confirm that you are connected to your learning cluster and remove the previous ReplicaSet and its managed Pods before starting this lab.

### Evidence

No screenshots required.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up the Working Directory

## Goal

Create and enter the dedicated Deployment lab directory.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 01 — Output of `pwd` showing the directory ending in `/k8s-labs/deployments`

---

# Task 2 — Create the Basic Deployment

## Goal

Create a two-replica NGINX Deployment and verify the automatically managed ReplicaSet and Pods.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 02 — Completed basic `nginx-deployment.yaml` showing two replicas and the initial NGINX image

---

#### Screenshot 03 — Successful apply output and verification output showing the Deployment, its automatically created ReplicaSet, and two Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

---

# Task 3 — Configure the RollingUpdate Strategy

## Goal

Configure RollingUpdate to maintain the desired available replica count during an image update.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 04 — Updated YAML showing `RollingUpdate`, `maxSurge: 1`, and `maxUnavailable: 0`

# Task 4 — Perform and Roll Back an Image Update

## Goal

Update NGINX to 1.23.1, observe the rollout, and return to the previous stable revision.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 06 — Image-update command and rollout status showing successful completion

<![Image6](screenshots/Assignment3_task4a.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 07 — ReplicaSet output showing the previous and updated ReplicaSets, and Deployment details showing `nginx:1.23.1`

---

#### Screenshot 08 — Rollback command and rollout status showing successful completion

<![Image8](screenshots/Assignment3_task4c.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 09 — Rollout history and Deployment details showing the restored `nginx:1.21.1` image

---

# Task 5 — Scale the Deployment

## Goal

Scale the workload to five replicas and return it to two.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Scale-up command and output showing five Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

<![Image10](screenshots/Assignment3_task5a.png)>

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Scale-down command and output showing the final two Pods with `1/1` under `READY` and `Running` under `STATUS`

# Task 6 — Share Your Kubernetes Deployment Progress on WhatsApp Status

## Goal

Share your Kubernetes Deployment learning progress on WhatsApp Status, including your generated DMI leaderboard progress link.

### Steps

1. Go to the DMI Leaderboard.
2. Find your name and select **Share your progress**.
3. Click the **WhatsApp icon**.
4. Copy the automatically generated leaderboard message containing your rank and progress link.
5. Open WhatsApp and go to **Updates**.
6. Create a new text Status.
7. Copy and paste the message below.
8. Insert the generated leaderboard message in the indicated place.
9. Review and publish your Status.

### WhatsApp Status Message

I practiced Kubernetes Deployments as part of my DevOps learning journey! 🚀

Today, I deployed NGINX, configured rolling updates, updated the container image, and rolled back to the previous version.

I also scaled my Deployment from two Pods to five and back to two!

# Lab Summary

Write a short note explaining how Deployments manage ReplicaSets, perform rolling updates and rollbacks, and scale Pods.

In this project, I learned how Kubernetes Deployments manage application updates and availability. A Deployment creates and manages ReplicaSets, which ensure the required number of Pods are running. I also learned how to perform rolling updates to introduce a new application version gradually, roll back to a previous stable version when needed, and scale Pods up or down by changing the desired replica count. This project helped me understand how Kubernetes maintains the desired state of an application while making deployments more reliable and easier to manage.
